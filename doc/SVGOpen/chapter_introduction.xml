            is a client-side web application/library for advanced vector graphics in a web browser. Its range of applications starts from
            the display of simple bar charts and pie charts up to the interactive display of function graphs and 
            Geometry constructions used in schools and universities.
            Even more advanced features of JSXGraph are the on-the-fly solving of Differential Equation Systems, the display of 
            Lindenmayer systems<footnote><para>Inspired by the work of Sam Ruby:

            JSXGraph is a library which may be used in various situations. The main application is to serve as a client-side viewer for
            educational Mathematics materials for schools and universities. 
            Usually, these constructions, especially from Euclidean Geometry, are available in different propietary XML file formats, and are 
            intended to be displayed by their associated Java applet. 
            In order to compensate the slow demise of Java applets in the web browsers, JSXGraph may prove to be
            valuable. 
            At the moment JSXGraph supports the file format of 
            GEONExT<footnote><para><ulink url="http://geonext.de">http://geonext.de</ulink></para></footnote>, 
            Intergeo<footnote><para><ulink url="http://i2geo.net">http://i2geo.net</ulink></para></footnote>, 
            and - at least partially - 
            GeoGebra<footnote><para><ulink url="http://geogebra.org">http://geogebra.org</ulink></para></footnote>.
            Since JSXGraph comes with its own implementation of unzip and gunzip, 
            it should be easy to adapt JSXGraph to a whole varity of even more file formats.

            Beside the using it as viewer of existing material, the JSXGraph library may be used as an API for advanced special purpose visualizations.
            JSXGraph enables interactive experiments with sophisticated mathematical problems in the web browser. One example is the simulation
            of the epidemiology model for the swine flu<footnote><para><ulink url="http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wiki/index.php/SIR_model:_swine_flu">http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wiki/index.php/SIR_model:_swine_flu</ulink></para></footnote>.
            The possibilities of JSXGraph in this respect exceed by far the options offered by software which is common in schools today.
        </para>
        <para>
            Another possible application of JSXGraph is to use it as front end for server based applications. 
            One example is the widely-spread free statistics software R<footnote><para><ulink url="http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wiki/index.php/Analyze_data_with_the_Statistics_software_R">http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wiki/index.php/Analyze_data_with_the_Statistics_software_R</ulink></para></footnote>. 
            After the mouse up event is fired in this application, the coordinates of the points
            are sent via AJAX to the R interface on server side. After doing some R computations on the server side, the 
            web server sends the results back to the browser. There, the display is updated by JSXGraph. 
            A more simple application of JSXGraph can be the creation of charts on server side.
            For example, PHP could be used to generate JSXGraph charts which are sent to the web
            browser. In this way, the high quality of the vector graphics display can be fully exploited.
            The additional overhead of downloading JSXGraph is less than 100 kByte, which is smaller than most bitmap images.

            From a technical point of view, JSXGraph is implemented in JavaScript. It generates SVG output on Mozilla- and Webkit-based 
            browsers, and VML on the Internet Explorer. 
            Therefore, JSXGraph runs on every modern browser.
