This booklet shows how to use the open-source library JSXGraph (http://jsxgraph.org).

\marginnote{Interactive Geometry, plotting, visualization}

JSXGraph is a cross-browser library for interactive geometry, function plotting, graphs, and data visualization in a web browser. It is implemented completely in JavaScript and uses SVG and VML.
JSXGraph is easy to embed and has a small footprint: only about 80 kByte if embedded in a web page. No plug-ins are required! 

JSXGraph uses the JavaScript libraries/frameworks Prototype or jQuery.

JSXGraph is developed at the Lehrstuhl f\"ur Mathematik und ihre Didaktik, University of Bayreuth, Germany.
