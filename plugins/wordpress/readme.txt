Using the JSXGraph filter makes it a lot easier to embed JSXGraph constructions into wordpress pages/posts.

== Description ==

JSXGraph is a cross-browser library for interactive geometry, function plotting, graphs, and data visualization in a web browser. It is implemented completely in JavaScript and uses SVG and VML.
JSXGraph is easy to embed and has a small footprint: only about 55 KB if embedded in a web page. No plug-ins are required! JSXGraph uses the JavaScript libraries/frameworks Prototype or jQuery.
JSXGraph is developed at the Lehrstuhl f√ºr Mathematik und ihre Didaktik, University of Bayreuth, Germany.
